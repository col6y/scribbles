# Scribbles

Drawings with LISP!

Currently, this is very much in the early prototype stage. Don't bother with it.

# Licensing

No license is specified, meaning that you only have the rights that GitHub guarantees:
the right to view this code, and the right to fork this code.
I plan to add a real license if this ever gets out of the prototype stage.
